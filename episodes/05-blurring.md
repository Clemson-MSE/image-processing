In this episode, we will learn how to use OpenCV functions to blur images.
When we blur an image, we make the color transition from one side of an 
edge in the image to another smooth rather than sudden. The blur, or smoothing,
of an image removes "outlier" pixels that may be noise in the image. A blur
is a very common operation we need to perform before other tasks such as 
edge detection.
