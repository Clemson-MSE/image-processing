Consider the following two types of problems that might be of interest to a 
scientist.

1. Morphometrics. Morphometrics involves counting the number of objects in an 
	image, analyzing the size of the objects, or analyzing the shape of the
	objects. For example, we might be interested in analyzing the change in
	the shape of the roots of plant seedlings over time. 

2. Colorimetrics. Colorimetrics involves analyzing the color of objects in an 
	image. For example, we might look at a time series of images of a 
	chemical reaction, noting when a color change takes place in the 
	solution.
